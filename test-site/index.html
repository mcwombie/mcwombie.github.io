<h1>Things Relating to <em>A Course in Miracles</em></h1>

        <h2>November 2020</h2>
    <p>This page contains reflections, links and material related to my own personal experience as a student and teacher of <em>A Course in Miracles</em>, which I began incorporating into my life in 2017. Since that time I have gone through three workbook and text cycles, been a member of various Facebook study groups and explored a few of the spinoff books and podcasts by other students/teachers including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Disappearance of the Universe</em> by Gary Renard</li>
      <li><em>Take Me to Truth</em> by Nouk Sanchez and Tomas Vieira</li>
      <li><em>A Crash Course in Miracles</em> by Philip Urso</li>
    </ul>
    
      
    <p>Presently I am reading <em>The Meaning of Forgiveness</em>
      by Kenneth Wapnick.</p>
      <p>Here is a link to <a href="https://removebarriers.libsyn.com">A Crash Course in Miracles Podcast</a> which I highly recommend. It is my intention to  continue daily exercises in the workbook next year as each re-read unveils new and deeper meaning.</p>
